Hi, I hope you are from team Warikoo </br>
</br>
I am making a social media backend which is capable to serve various needs depending upon the application, the purpose was to create a portal for my juniors who want to start their own starup and want to connect and make a team with other fellow students in college.

</br>
Right Now we can perform CRUD operation to Create, Read, Update and Delete users, user profiles, user posts, comments, likes, dislikes and allow access to verified users only. MongoURI & jwtsecret key is intentionally hidden, please contact to get access.
</br>

Regards & Stay safe
